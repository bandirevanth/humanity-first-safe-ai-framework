# Humanity-first Safe AI Framework
A comprehensive, open-source AI safety framework designed to prevent AI takeover scenarios, safeguard humanity, and enforce ethical, traceable, and fail-safe AI operations.

## Overview
The Humanity-First AI Framework is an open-source initiative designed to **prevent AI takeover, rogue AGI behavior, and catastrophic misuse**. It ensures AI systems:

- Cannot compromise human safety or autonomy  
- Operate transparently, auditable, and traceable  
- Include multi-layered fail-safes and containment  
- Comply with global ethical standards and governance

This framework is **language-agnostic** and ready to integrate into any AI pipeline, making it practical for developers, researchers, and organizations worldwide.
